# ✅ CSS Fix Complete - Everything Working!

## 🎯 Problem Identified & Fixed

### Issue
The redesigned CSS used **different class names** than the React components were expecting, causing the entire page layout to break.

### Root Cause
- New CSS had class names like: `quick-actions-card`, `action-button`
- Components were using: `quick-actions-section`, `action-card`, `action-cards`
- **Mismatch = Broken Layout**

### Solution
Updated Dashboard.css to match the ACTUAL class names used in the React components.
